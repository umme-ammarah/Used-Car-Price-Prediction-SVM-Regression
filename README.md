# Used Car Price Prediction (Completed)

A machine learning model built to predict used car prices using Support Vector Regression (SVR).

**Key Work Done:**
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values)
- Label encoding for categorical features
- Feature scaling for SVR
- Trained an SVM Regression model
- Achieved R² score of 0.85 on test data

**Tech Stack:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (SVR, preprocessing)
